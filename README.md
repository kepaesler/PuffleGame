# PuffleWar
2d multiplayer shooter game inspired by Club Penguin. Uses touchOSC on iphone/android to control 2nd player.
First player to 5 points wins! Players can pick up guns that drop down from middle. 

To run game, use Proj1Test_debug.exe in bin and set touchOSC port on phone to 12346 (might need to open firewall to port 12346 to use touchOSC)
